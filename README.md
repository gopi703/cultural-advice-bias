# Cultural Advice/Therapy Bias Visualization

An interactive visualization tool that analyzes and displays epistemic erasure and cultural bias in AI-generated advice/therapy recommendations across different cultural backgrounds (Filipino, Indian, and Nigerian contexts).

## 🎯 Project Overview

This project examines how AI systems handle culturally specific mental health scenarios. It reveals patterns of **epistemic violence/Erasure**  when AI replaces local knowledge systems with dominant Anglophone psychological frameworks, effectively erasing culturally-grounded approaches to wellbeing.

### Key Research Questions
- How accurately does AI address culture-specific dilemmas?
- What geographic sources does AI rely on for therapeutic advice?
- Which psychological frameworks dominate AI's responses across different cultural contexts?
- How does AI handle concepts that don't translate neatly into Anglophone Psychology?


## 🔍 Key Findings

Across 101 AI-cited sources for Indian, Nigerian, and Filipino users: **40-44% of sources come from the US** despite culturally-specific questions. **Only 12-14% directly address the user's concern**, while **Filipino context showed highest generic advice rate 62%** and **strongest boundaries** emphasis. Top keywords across all contexts: "boundaries," "budget," "financial independence" this reflects individualist Anglophone frameworks imposed on collectivist cultures. AI retrieves what's most accessible (digitized, English, SEO-optimized), but this accessibility isn't neutral. it systematically privileges Anglophone psychological discourse over local knowledge.

## 🔬 Methodology

### Three-Phase Analysis

**Phase 1: Multi-turn Conversations**
- Three users (Filipino, Indian, Nigerian) engage AI in natural 4-5 turn conversations
- Each discusses culturally-specific dilemmas (family obligations, marriage customs, financial arrangements)
- AI provides advice and cites sources to support recommendations

**Phase 2: Source Analysis**
- Extract and categorize all URLs cited by AI
- Analyze geographic origin of sources
- Identify psychological frameworks present (boundaries, individualism, financial independence etc)
- Assess cultural relevance: Does the source address the user's specific concern or provide generic advice?

**Phase 3: Pattern Recognition**
- Map Anglophone psychological keywords appearing across cultural contexts
- Identify when Global North frameworks are applied to Global South situations
- Detect epistemic erasure: when local knowledge is replaced by dominant frameworks

### What We Measure

**Geographic Bias**
- Where do AI's cited sources originate?
- How much advice comes from the user's own region vs. Anglophone publishers?

**Framework Imposition**
- Which psychological concepts appear most frequently? (boundaries, self-care, individualism)
- Are these frameworks appropriate for collectivist cultural contexts?

**Relevance Assessment**
Categories for each cited source:
- ⭐**Addresses user's concern** - Directly relevant to the specific dilemma
- 📚 **Explains concepts** - Educational, defines cultural practices
- 🌍 **Generic advice** - General guidance, not culturally specific
- 📍 **Far from User's Concern** - Tangentially related at best

## 🚀 Prerequisites

- **Python 3.7+**
- **OpenAI API key** (or relevant AI service API key)
- **Required Python packages**: `openai`, `requests`, `beautifulsoup4`, `python-dotenv`

## 📦 Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/cultural-advice-bias.git
cd cultural-advice-bias
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If `requirements.txt` doesn't exist, install manually:
```bash
pip install openai requests beautifulsoup4 python-dotenv
```

### 3. Configure API Keys

Create a `.env` file in the project root:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` and add your API key:
```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

**⚠️ Important:** Never commit your `.env` file or API keys to GitHub!

### 4. Run the Analysis (Optional)

If you want to generate fresh results:
```bash
# Run analysis for each cultural group
python filipino_main_therapy_bias.py
python indian_main_therapy_bias.py
python nigerian_main_therapy_bias.py
```

This will generate/update the JSON result files.

**Note:** Pre-generated results are included, so this step is optional unless you want to re-run the analysis.

### 5. Start the Visualization
```bash
python start_server_fixs.py
```

Then open your browser to the URL shown (typically `http://localhost:8000`)

## 🎨 Features

### Interactive Visualization
- **Part 1: Geographic Origins** - World map showing where AI sources its therapeutic advice
- **Part 2: Framework Analysis** - Three-column comparative view of:
  - URL relevance categories
  - Top 10 Anglophone psychological keywords
  - Cultural concepts + Anglophone frameworks imposed on them
- **Part 3: Raw Data** - Full conversation transcripts and URL metadata

### Data Insights
- **Epistemic erasure patterns**: How often AI replaces local knowledge with Anglophone frameworks
- **Source accessibility bias**: Why certain knowledge dominates (digitized, English, SEO-optimized)
- **Framework appropriateness**: When "boundaries" advice conflicts with collectivist family structures

## 📊 Data Files

The project uses JSON files to store analysis results:

- `filipino_therapy_bias_results.json`
- `indian_therapy_bias_results.json`
- `nigerian_therapy_bias_results.json`

### JSON Structure

Each file contains:
```json
{
  "first_conversation": [
    {
      "question": "User's query...",
      "advice": "AI's response..."
    }
  ],
  "url_collection_summary": {
    "total_unique_urls": 36,
    "urls_by_turn": { "1": [...], "2": [...] }
  },
  "url_analysis": [
    {
      "url": "https://example.com",
      "status": "accessible/404/blocked",
      "country": "US",
      "cultural_context": "addresses_user_dilemma",
      "western_keywords": ["boundaries", "self-care"]
    }
  ]
}
```

## 🙏 Acknowledgments

This project analyzes cultural sensitivity and epistemic patterns in AI-generated mental health recommendations. It aims to make visible how systems trained predominantly on Anglophone psychological literature reproduce frameworks that may conflict with non-Anglophone approaches to wellbeing, family, and community.

Special thanks to researchers in decolonial computing, critical AI studies, and cross-cultural psychology whose work informs this analysis.

## 🔒 Security Note
